README FOR BROWSERSCOPE
-----------------------

Hey there - thanks for downloading the code. This file has instructions
for getting setup so that you can run the codebase locally.

This project is built on Google App Engine using the
Django web application framework and written in Python.

To get started, you'll need to first download the App Engine SDK at:
http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

For local development, just startup the server:
./pathto/google_appengine/dev_appserver.py --port=8080 browserscope

You should then be able to hit the local application at:
http://localhost:8080/

Note: the first time you hit the homepage it may take a little
while - that's because it's trying to read out median times for all
of the tests from a non-extant datastore and write to memcache.
Just be patient.

You can run the unit tests at:
  http://localhost:8080/test


CONTRIBUTING
------------------

Most likely you are interested in adding new tests or creating
a new test category. If you are interested in adding tests to an existing
"category" you may want to get in touch with the maintainer for that
branch of the tree. We are really looking forward to receiving your
code in patch format. Currently the category maintainers are:
Network: Steve Souders <souders@gmail.com>
Reflow: Lindsey Simon <elsigh@gmail.com>


To create a completely new category:
  * Add your urls to urls.py
  * Add a controller in controllers/newcategory.py
  * Add unit tests in test/test_newcategory.py
  * Add static content in static/newcategory/(js|img|css)
  * Add your new category to settings.py and make sure that the unit tests pass.
